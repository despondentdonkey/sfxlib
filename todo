    LIBRARY:
Do not abstract this into multiple objects, there's not much point to do so since the Web Audio API has covered most of it. This library will:

Load buffers easily and allow you to integrate the loading into any engine.
Play sound sources with common game properties like gain, pan, etc
It will also contain any audio utilities.

Anything more complex can just use the Web Audio API

    IDEAS:
Create sets or tracks which are sound sources that contain the same effects.

Create a way to crossfade between two sets or tracks.

Add 3D panning and a basic left/right panning.

Have playSound be able to use other audio nodes.
