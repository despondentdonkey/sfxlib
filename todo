    LIBRARY:
Do not abstract this into multiple objects, there's not much point to do so since the Web Audio API has covered most of it. This library will:

Load buffers easily and allow you to integrate the loading into any engine.
Play sound sources with common game properties like gain, pan, etc
It will also contain any audio utilities.

Anything more complex can just use the Web Audio API. But this library should aid with the Web Audio API, it shouldn't be a take it or leave it kinda thing.

    IDEAS:
Have playSound be able to use other audio nodes.

    OBJECT BASED DESIGN:
var bufferFile;

var sound = createSound(bufferFile.buffer, {
    gain: 0.1,
});

sound.play(delay)
sound.stop(delay)
sound.playNew(delay, opt) - Duplicates the sound, plays it and returns it. opt can be used to override current options.
sound.gain = 0.5;
sound.loop = false;
